II.	Introduction

This software was written with the purpose of creating magazine apps 
with high resolution images that could easily and quickly be created using 
existing backend software. 

It uses one main XML file (see magazine.xml) that defines the content of a magazine. 
It supports so-called side-controllers which can hold content such as context sensitive 
Twitter messages and a table of contents, both of these side controllers are included
in this release.

Overlays are views that sit on top of a magazine page and display various
contextual information. A simple overlay controller is included that views links inside 
of a web browser.

--------------------

III.	Requirements

* iOS 4+ SDK 
* Lib XML 2

This software depends on and acknowledges the following third-party libraries: 

* TouchXML
* Google Toolbox for Mac (GTM)
* SBJson framework

--------------------

IV.	Notes

* There is currently no built-in way to switch from landscape (the default orientation) to 
portrait. For the PageViewController, which has a complex view hierarchy, a portrait 
version is provided. 

* The PageViewController consists of several views that are essential for creating the
page turning effect. The main layer holds: 

1. Page Turn Container
Contains a left and right 'leaf' image, During page turning, this is the layer that is animated
like a revolving door. The FX layer darkens the page during turn.

2. Main page container 
Holds the images for both 'leaves'. When a page turn is done, the appropriate leaves are shuffled 
around during animation to transition to the new page. The imageBuffer view is currently only
used to blend in the overlay view with the full page and might be removed in future releases.

3. fxBookShadow
Holds an image that simulates the shadow that is cast by a turning page.

4. Overlay Container
This view holds the views for any overlays.
